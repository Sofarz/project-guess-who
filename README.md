# Project Name

Project built during the Technigo Bootcamp week 5. The project itself consisted in creating a digital version of the old character guessing board game "Guess Who"?

The main focus for this project was to learn about objects, arrays, methods such as forEach() and filter() and how to structure code in functions.

## The problem

I approached the problem by looking through all the code that was prewritten for us, as well as reading through all the hints and steps given to get us started. 
When I got stuck I looked for answers in Slack and stackOverflow and discussed with other people how they had approached a specific problem.
If I had more time, I would have changed the styling and added more properties to all the characters.
